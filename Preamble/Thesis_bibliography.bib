	Smart City refer to the city that integrates modern technologies for automated and efficient service providing to enhance citizens’ lifestyle. Latest studies show that like 60 present of the whole world's population will be living in urban environments by the year 2030. This massively growing population in urban environments leads to the need of advanced management approaches that use latest IT platforms and techniques for smartening every city-related service. Such emergent integration of technologies faces several security- related challenges because of not considering security tests of new deployed technologies, in addition to not engaging other system parties with security incidents due to the huge communication. On the other side, high complexity, high interdependency and intensive communication lead to unbounded attack surface and cryptography-related issues. In our paper, we intend to provide detailed overview based on literature of smart cities’ major security problems and current solutions. Moreover, we present several influencing factors that affect data and information security in smart cities."
